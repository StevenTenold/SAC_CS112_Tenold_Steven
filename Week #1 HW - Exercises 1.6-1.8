Homework – Week #1 (Resubmission)

1.6 Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:
a) Java programs normally go through five phases – edit, compile, load, verify, & execute.

b) A(n) Integrated Development Environment (IDE) provides many tools that support the software development process such as editors for writing and editing programs, debuggers for locating logic errors in programs, and many other features.

c) The command java invokes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which executes Java programs

d) A Virtual Machine is a software application that simulates a computer, but hides the underlying operating system and hardware from the programs that interact with it

e) The class loader takes the .class file(s) containing the program’s bytecodes & transfers them to primary memory

f) The bytecode verifier examines bytecodes to ensure that they’re valid

1.7 Explain the two compilation phases of Java Programs
	The first compilation phase takes place during Phase 2: Compiling a Java Program into Bytecodes. During this process, the line(s) of code within the class are compiled, detecting any syntax error(s), into bytecodes (aka Machine Language) that the computer would use to execute the program. The machine language is subject to bytecode verification before the second phase of compilation begins.
	The second phase of compilation takes place during Phase 5: Execution. During execution, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes bytecodes with a combination of interpretation and a process called just-in-time (JIT) compilation, which translates bytecodes into the underlying computer’s machine language.

1.8 One of the World’s most common objects is a wrist watch. Discuss how each of the following terms and concepts applies to the notion of a wrist watch.
	a) Object
		The Watch
	b) Attribute(s)
		The style, band, color, watch face, & manufacturer
	c) Behavior(s)
		Keeping time accurately (Date/Day of week too depending on watch)
	d) Class
		Setting the Watch, Setting the Alarm, Setting the Date & Day of the week
	e) Inheritance (Consider, for example, an Alarm Clock)
Old watches told time, newer watches kept this characteristic while also offering other functions such as date, day of the week, alarm(s), stop watches, timers, etc
	f) Modeling
		Universal Face of a clock (12 at top, 6 at bottom, knob on side to adjust)
	g) Message(s)
Knob sends message to hands of clock to change, buttons send message to watch to begin timer or set alarm, etc
	h) Encapsulation
The process(s) that allow the watch to keep track of time accurately down to the second are not widely known or shared
	i) Interface
Explained in the user manual, simplified button(s) like start, stop, menu, alarm, etc
j) Information Hiding
My watch knows the time I have it set to, but it does not know the time of the watch the person next to me is wearing.
