Object-Oriented features used within this program:

Methods - Methods created to perform tasks
Classes - Classes to house the set of methods within our object
Encapsulation - An instance of the FlyingThings object contains the attributes (unique to the object instance) & methods
Information Hiding - "private" variables within the FlyingThings class creates variables with values that can only be accessed by methods within the class.
Constructors - Constructors allow for an instance of the object to be created "new". Each "new" object contains it's own
  unique attributes. Every new object that is created within Java requires a constructor call, & constructor calls
  can differ based on the parameters set, and how those parameters assign values to the attributes/private variables.
Polymorphism - Different Constructor Calls allow for the constructor to take different forms
  FOR EXAMPLE: 
  
  public FlyingThing(int m){
		airSpeed = m;
	}
	
	public FlyingThing(int m, int f){
		airSpeed = m;
		altimeter = f;
	}
