Chapter 3 Homework Assignment: Part 2 - Exercises 3.1 - 3.4
  
  Exercise 3.1
a) Each class declaration that begins with keyword PUBLIC must be stored in a file that has exactly the same name as the class and ends with the .java file name extension
  
b) Keyword CLASS in a class declaration is followed immediately by the class's name.
 
c) Keyword NEW requests 

d) memory from the system to store an object, then calls the corresponding class's constructor to initialize the object, d2) Each parameter must specify both a TYPE and a NAME

e) By default classes that are compiled in the same directory are considered to be in the same package, known as the DEFAULT PACKAGE.
  
f) Java provides two primitive types for storing floating-point numbers in memory: FLOAT and DOUBLE
  	
g) Variables of type double represent DOUBLE-PRECISION floating-point numbers.
  
h) Scanner method NEXTDOUBLE returns a double value
  
i) Keyword public is an access MODIFIER
  
j) Return type VOID indicates that a method will not return a value
  
k) Scanner method NEXTLINE reads characters until it encounters a newline character, then returns those characters as a String.

  	l) Class String is in package JAVA.LANG
  
m) An IMPORT DECLARATION is not required if you always refer to a class with its fully qualified class name
  
n) A FLOATING-POINT NUMBER is a number with a decimal point, such as 7.33, 0.0975, or 1000.12345
  
o) Variables of type float represent SINGLE-precision floating point numbers
  
p) The format specifier %F is used to output values of type float or double.
  
q) Types in java are divided into two categories: PRIMITIVE and REFERENCE.
  
Exercise 3.2
  a. FALSE - Method names should begin with a lower case letter, however if the name contains multiple words, the subsequent words should be capitalized to allow for easier identification/reading
  
b. True
  
c. True
  
d. FALSE - Only reference types can be used to invoke methods
  
e. FALSE - Variables declared within a method can only be used within that method as they are only stored during the execution of the method
  
f. True
  
g. FALSE - LOCAL primitive-type values MUST be assigned a value
  h. True
  
i. True
  
j. True
  
k. False as these are DOUBLE-type by default.
  
Exercise 3.3 
  
A local variable is declared within a method & stored in memory during the execution of the method. These variables cannot be called upon outside of their respective method(s). An instance variable, on the other hand, is declared within the CLASS & outside of any individual methods. These variables can be called throughout the class within any one of its methods.
  
Exercise 3.4  
  
A method parameter is basically a "condition" in which the method is executed. If the parameter is met, the method is executed. If not, the method is not executed.
